	<br>What to do if you are sick the day of an exam
	If you don't feel well the day of the exam and feel like you will be unable to complete it, you must go to the college doctor the day of the exam in order to be allowed to defer that exam until the August exam period without capping. The university no longer forces you to defer all remaining exams if you have to defer one so please do contact the college health unit if you are unwell. Call (091) 492 604. More information regarding deferrals is available <a href="https://www.nuigalway.ie/exams/timetable-advice/deferrals/">here</a>

	<br>What to do if you cannot find your student card
	There is a 25 euro fine for each exam that you fail to present your student card in. To get another student card printed you must go to Student Information Desk (SID) and there is 20 euro reprint fee. SID opens early during the exam period to ensure students can have a valid student card before the first exam. <a href= "http://www.nuigalway.ie/student-registry-helpdesk/">More information about SID </a>
